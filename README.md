Project Idea/Mentor:
API for calculating ETH supply
By Tim Beiko

An API endpoint that calculates the current supply of ETH. Create basic specification and implementation which should get merged in at least one EL<>CL combo and maybe even the API specs. 
Ideally, works on multiple clients and you can compare the output.
